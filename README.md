Code for the Robo-Disher: a robot that does the dishes.

DISCLAIMER: The Robo-Disher requires a dish rack above the sink and a rack for the cleaning utilities (soap, iron wool, etc.)
This repository is for the code of my new invention: the Robo-Disher. The Robo-Disher (RD for short) will take in a dish, take photos from different angles (90째 or directly above for plates & utensils, and 45째 for bowls and cups) and compare the 90째 photo to all images of dirty plates and utensils in the database, while comparing the 45째 photo to all images of dirty bowls and cups. If any of them have a 30% or more match, it will scrub or rinse according to the type of dish. Once the dish has a 75% or more match with the clean dish photos, it will move the current dish to the rack and get the next dish.
